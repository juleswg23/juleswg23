## Hi I'm Jules ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from Williams College in 2023 with a double major in computer science and math. Most recently, I spent a year in Spain teaching computer science, among other topics, at a vocational school. Earlier, I finished a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in summer of 2022 in which I spent time building out the project below that I am revisiting now!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Typescript!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my [connect four](https://github.com/juleswg23/my-first-website) server-client game.
