## Hi I'm Jules ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from Williams College in 2023 with a double major in computer science and math. After my undergrad, I spent a year in Spain teaching computer science, among other topics, at a vocational school. Earlier, I engaged in batches at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in summer of 2022 and fall of 2024 in which I spent time building out a number of projects! Most recently I helped out in the Michigan Dems 2024 campaign, writing some texting scripts and mostly organzing volunteer door-knockers and phone bankers.

Currently I'm working as a software developer for a local high school.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about and working on a React/NextJS project!
- ðŸ”­ It's backed by a Postgresql database, a Prisma ORM, and vanilla CSS styling.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also currently learning how to toy around with R Shiny apps, one of which can be found [here](https://jules-dev.shinyapps.io/analyzingdanieldata/).
- ðŸ‘¯ I spend my free time rock climbing, playing soccer and table tennis, and volunteering at a weekly legal clinic.
