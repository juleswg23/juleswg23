## Hi I'm Jules 👋

I graduated from Williams College in 2023 with a double major in computer science and math. After my undergraduate education, I spent a year in Spain teaching computer science, among other topics, at a vocational school. I've also had the good fortune to join batches at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in summer of 2022 and fall of 2024 in which I spent time building out a number of projects, like [this](https://github.com/juleswg23/latin-square) or [this](https://github.com/juleswg23/connect-four-live)!

Last year, I helped out in the Michigan Dems 2024 campaign, writing some texting scripts and mostly organzing volunteer door-knockers and phone bankers. More recently I worked as a maintainer for an in-house Student Information Service for a local high school, which entailed a full-stack React/NextJS project deployed on Vercel.

Currently I'm working as a Great Tables intern for Posit!

- 🔭 My role now involves the development of a supplemental [great-tables](https://github.com/posit-dev/great-tables) package called [gt-extras](https://github.com/juleswg23/gt-extras)!
- 🔭 It's written in Python, and built for the same functionality offered by a sister R package, found [here](https://github.com/jthomasmock/gtExtras).
- 🌱 I’m also currently learning how to toy around with R Shiny apps, one of which can be found [here](https://jules-dev.shinyapps.io/Marion-Stokes-Tapes-Dashboard/).
- 💬 I’m looking to collaborate on [gt-extras](https://github.com/juleswg23/gt-extras), please submit issues and PR's if you're interested!
- 👯 I spend my free time rock climbing, playing soccer and table tennis, and volunteering at a weekly legal clinic.
